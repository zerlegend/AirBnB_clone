- `css` directory: Contains the CSS files for styling the HTML pages.
- `images` directory: Contains the image files used in the web pages.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file representing the home page of the AirBnB application.

## HTML

The HTML files define the structure and content of the web pages. In this project, the main HTML file is `index.html`, which serves as the home page. It includes the necessary tags and elements to create a user-friendly interface.

## CSS

The CSS files in the `css` directory are responsible for styling the HTML pages. The `styles.css` file contains the CSS rules that define the visual appearance of the web pages. It includes selectors targeting specific HTML elements and applies properties such as colors, fonts, margins, and padding to achieve the desired styling.

## Images

The `images` directory stores the image files used in the web pages. These images are referenced in the HTML files using the `<img>` tag and the `src` attribute. They enhance the visual presentation of the AirBnB application.
